This code can be used as follows.(Refer to Paper)
1. Only Online Calibration
2. Online Calibration with Reference Extrinsic --> To extract changed sensor pose(due to time or physical change)

"extrinsic_parameters.bin" is reference extrinsic data from offline calibration.
The purpose of "2" is to extract changed poses, and sensor pose of sample_db was changed from pose of "extrinsic_parameters.bin"
